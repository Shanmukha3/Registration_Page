# Registration and Login Pages

This repository contains simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for a basic registration and login system with form validation. The project consists of two HTML files (`register.html` and `login.html`) and a shared JavaScript file (`register.js`). The styling is done using the `style.css` file.

## Files

- **register.html**: HTML file for the registration page.
- **login.html**: HTML file for the login page.
- **style.css**: CSS file for styling.
- **register.js**: JavaScript file containing form validation functions.

## Registration Page

The registration page (`register.html`) includes form fields for username, password, re-enter password, and email. The JavaScript file (`register.js`) provides client-side validation for these form fields.

## Login Page

The login page (`login.html`) includes form fields for username and password. Validation for these fields is handled by the `register.js` file as well.

## Usage

1. Open `register.html` to access the registration page.
2. Fill in the required information and submit the form.
3. Open `login.html` to access the login page.
4. Provide your username and password for login.

## Form Validation

- **Username**: The first character should be a capital letter, and it should contain at least one special character.

- **Password**: Should contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one special character.

- **Re-enter Password**: Should match the original password.

- **Email**: Should be a valid email address.
